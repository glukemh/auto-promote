# Auto Promote

A Google Chrome extension that automatically promotes specified users to moderator status on ConexED. Additionally, makes the save pdf button visible on whiteboards.

# Usage

- All moderators must have a common prefix to the username for auto-promote to work. For example, prefix every moderator that needs to promoted with "mod.", then enter "mod." in the popup of this extension.

- The classroom owner must keep the users tab open. Auto-promote won't detect moderators otherwise.

- Change the prefix indicator in the popup if needed, or cancel to stop automatically promoting.

- The pdf button that is made visible in the toolbar on whiteboards will download all pages of the whiteboard to a pdf.
